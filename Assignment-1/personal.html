		<div id="aboutMeText">
			Most of my life I identified as musician.  For the past decade, I worked professionally as a recording artist and songwriter for Sony/BMG Music Entertainment.
			<p>
				More recently, however, I spend most of my time studying.  A few years ago, I went back to school, and am currently enrolled at <span class="furd">Stanford University</span> in a program for electrical engineering.
				<p>
					Before transfering into <span class="furd">Stanford</span>, I was studying at a community college in Santa Monica while also running a recording studio.  Prior to that, I was mostly on the road touring in support of various recordings.
					<p>
						Some of the instruments that I play proficiently include:
